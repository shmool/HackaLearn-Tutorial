# Add your app to GitHub

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code repository website, which integrates with Git. It allows you to publish your project on the Web, copy \(fork and clone\) other open source projects and collaborate. To be able to publish your project, make sure you [create a user on GitHub](https://github.com/signup) \(for free, of course\).

There are several ways to add a project to your GitHub account. You can fork a project from another organization, create a new one from within the GitHub platform and clone it to your local machine, or create a project locally and upload it as a new GitHub repository. Since we've created the front-end app locally, we will upload it to a new repository.

> If you're forking a project that is deployed on Static Web Apps, make sure to delete the workflow file which is connected to the original repository. Otherwise, you will have failing actions.

If you haven't done this yet, [create a user on GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
